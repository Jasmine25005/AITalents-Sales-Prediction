# 🏆 AI Talents League R1: Sales Prediction Engine


This repository contains my complete solution for the **AI Talents League Round 1** competition. The goal is to predict product sales based on a diverse set of item and outlet features. The project demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline, including exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling with a `RandomForestRegressor`.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The core of this project is a single Jupyter Notebook (`sales_prediction_notebook.ipynb`) that provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. My approach emphasizes a deep understanding of the data to build a robust and accurate predictive model.

### 🎯 Key Features:
* **Comprehensive EDA**: In-depth analysis using visualizations to uncover data distributions, correlations, and outliers.
* **Systematic Preprocessing**: A structured approach to handling missing values, data inconsistencies, and outliers.
* **Smart Feature Engineering**: Creation of new, impactful features like `Item_Category` from existing IDs to improve model performance.
* **Robust Modeling**: Implementation of a `RandomForestRegressor` and evaluation using cross-validation to ensure reliable results.
* **Clear Interpretation**: Analysis of feature importances to understand the key drivers behind the model's predictions.
